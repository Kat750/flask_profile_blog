                <li>Networking for Success: Recognizing the significance of community and collaboration, I actively engaged with work-related resources such as Software Cornwall and their Adult Tech Jam. These interactions served as transformative turning points, introducing me to Codecademy and steering my focus toward mastering Python.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Python emerged as my language of choice, igniting a new level of enthusiasm and engagement. Each milestone I achieved instilled confidence, accelerating my progress and inspiring me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. My journey has been defined by an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement and a resilient spirit that pushes me to embrace new challenges head-on.</p>
